# The next variables are dictionaries that define the topology of the deployments.

# A given Openshift/K8s deployment might have one or more routers, and we will
# assign a diferent name for each (l7router for short). 
#
# Topology variables are indexed by these l7router names.
#
# apiEndpoint:   Contains the URL of the apiEndpoint of each l7router. Deployments with
#                several routers will have the same URL for different l7routers. 
#              
# publicAddress: Contains the public IP address (host names should not be used) of each l7router that will be load balanced
#                by the F5 Cloud Services DNS LB. This IP is unique for each l7router.
